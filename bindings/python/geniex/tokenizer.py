        ``tokenize=True`` is rejected — the C runtime handles tokenisation
        internally, so callers should pass the returned string straight to
        :meth:`GenieXLLM.generate`. ``tools`` accepts a list of dicts or a
        pre-serialised JSON string.

        ``enable_thinking`` semantics:

        * ``None`` (default) — auto-resolve. For thinking-capable models we
          enable thinking; for non-thinking models we still pass ``True`` so
          the underlying ChatML template skips the empty
          ``<think>\\n\\n</think>\\n\\n`` suppression block (that block is
          only meaningful for *thinking* models being asked to skip a turn,
          and on non-thinking instruct models it derails generation).
        * ``True`` — same as auto-resolve.
        * ``False`` — explicitly ask a thinking-capable model to skip its
          thinking turn. Forced to ``True`` (with a warning) on non-thinking
          models, where the suppression block is OOD.

        See :attr:`GeniexLLM.supports_thinking` for how the capability is
        detected.
