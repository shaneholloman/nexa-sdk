"""Fixtures for the Python binding contract tests.

End-to-end SDK / generation coverage lives in the top-level ``tests/``
suite. This file stays focused on binding-layer tests (CLI wrapper,
progress callbacks, model_manager Python surface, local pull paths) and
only pulls a small public GGUF when a binding test needs a real cached
model on disk.
