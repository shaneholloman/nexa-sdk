//! Pluggable log sink for the core crate.
//!
//! Core has no logging facade and must not depend on the FFI crate —
//! that would invert the `ffi -> core` dependency. Instead it exposes a
//! global sink that the FFI layer installs at init time (see
//! `crates/ffi/src/logging.rs`), forwarding into geniex's C log callback.
//! Until a sink is installed — plain-Rust use, unit tests — messages
//! fall back to stderr so nothing is silently dropped.
