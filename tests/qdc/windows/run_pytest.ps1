# QDC pytest entry — X Elite Windows ARM64.
#
# QDC's POWERSHELL framework extracts the artifact zip to C:\Temp\TestContent\
# and runs this script there; anything written under C:\Temp\QDC_Logs\ is
# auto-uploaded as job logs. The artifact (built by run_qdc_pytest.py) ships
# pkg-geniex (windows-arm64 SDK), the bindings/python tree, the tests/ tree,
# the HTP self-signed cert, and the VLM sample image — see build_windows_artifact.

# separately and uncomment the import-site line in pythonNN._pth so site
# packages and PYTHONPATH are honoured.
